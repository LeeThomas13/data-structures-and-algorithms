# Reverse an Array
reverse this array [1,5,7,9,6,3,-1,-3,-6]

## Challenge
I need to figure out how to take in an array, and completely reverse everything inside of it. ie [1,2,3,4] becomes [4,3,2,1]. Aswell as [5,-7,9,8,-15] becomes [-15,8,9,-7,5].

## Approach & Efficiency
I plan to use the iteration technique of [::-1] to reverse the array.

## Solution
my_list[::-1]
