# Stacks and Queues
Stacks are a data structure that works 'vertically' like a pringles can. you can easily add something to the top of the stack and remove something from the top. It follows the FIFO or LIFO  principles. Queues are a data structure that works horizontally, kind of like the people movers you see at the airport. its easy to add to the back of the queue and it follows the FIFO or the LILO principles.

## Challenge
Make a stack and queue data structure class. the stack should include functions like init, pop, push, peek, and error handling. The queue should include functions such as init, enqueue, dequeue, peek, and error handling. Everything must pass all tests.

## Approach & Efficiency
Commit 1 was pretty simple and I will return to it tomorrow, but basically i was able to instantiate both a stack and a queue, as well as pop into a stack and enqueue the queue. Nothing else has been handled so far.
